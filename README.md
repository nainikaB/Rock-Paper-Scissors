# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Brief Overview of the game
This computer game has been recreated from what was commonly played as kids, a popular game played by all kids. But here, instead of playing with another person, you play against your computer or other electronic device. It has been created using freecodecamp's tutorials along with me creating a few changes to it. 

# Instructions
- The game is relatively easy to play, it's always users that begins the game.
- Once the user picks from either rock, paper or scissors, the computer will play simultaneously triggering either a win, draw or lose.
- Whenever the user wins, the user gets the point.
- Whenever the computer wins, the computer gets the point.
- The one with the highest points win.
- Once you think you have finished the game or you want to restart, you can click on the restart button and the scores will return to 0.

# Rules of the game
- Paper covers rock, paper wins.
- Scissors cuts paper, scissor wins.
- Rock breaks scissor, rock wins.
